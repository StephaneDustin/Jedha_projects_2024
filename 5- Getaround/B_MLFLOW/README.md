## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

    First, clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Build the Docker Image

    Build the Docker image using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker build -t mlflow-app .
    ```

3. Run the Docker Container

    Run the Docker container and map the container's port 8080 to your local machine's port 8080:

    ```sh
    docker run -p 8080:8080 mlflow-app
    ```

4. Access the Application

    Open your web browser and go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

    You should see your MLFlow application running.

## Additional Information

### Customizing the Port

If you want to run the application on a different port, modify the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile and the docker run command accordingly. For example, to run on port 8000:

Modify Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
CMD mlflow server run --server.port 8000 app.py
```

Launch ML training:
Don't forget to write 'postgresql' instead of 'postgres' in BACKEND_STORE_URI generated by Heroku's settings.

```sh
docker run -it \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=  \
-e BACKEND_STORE_URI= \
-e ARTIFACT_ROOT= \
mlflow-app python app.py
```
